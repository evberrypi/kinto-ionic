This will need a file under src/environment/envrionment.ts to store the bearer token that we will be using in this tutorial.
This is temporary until I fix Kinto.js to be able to work with Ionic/Angular/Typescript.

```
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  ghkey: 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX',
};

```
